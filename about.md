# Who am I

Iâ€™m a developer driven by a passion for crafting innovative software solutions. I specialize in Embedded Linux and enjoys tinkering with Hardware and sharing knowledge with the community.

Something more:
- I'm interested in Free and open-source software.
- I enjoy learning new programming languages / frameworks / technology.
- I reside in Kirkkonummi, Finland with my family (me, wife and two daughters).
